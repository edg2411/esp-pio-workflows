# ESP32 PlatformIO CI/CD Workflow

This project tests the use of GitHub Actions to build and generate artifacts (binaries) for ESP32 firmware using PlatformIO.

## Overview

- **Build Environment:** ESP32
- **Tool:** PlatformIO
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions

## GitHub Actions Workflow

The workflow file, located in the `.github/workflows` directory, automates the following:
- Installing dependencies
- Building the project with PlatformIO
- Archiving the generated binaries as artifacts

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have PlatformIO installed.
2. Customize the [PlatformIO configuration](// ...existing code...) as needed.
3. Trigger a build by pushing changes to the repository.

## Artifacts

After a successful build, the firmware binaries for ESP32 are available as downloadable artifacts in the GitHub Actions run details.
